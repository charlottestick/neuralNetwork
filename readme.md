# Neural Network project
This is a simple neural network designed to classify images of objects and scenes at three different levels of detail and accuracy.

## Prerequisites

Tensorflow needs to be installed with pip or anaconda to run.

## Running the code

The trained models are stored in the models folder and are loaded by the agent. To run some predictions, instantiate an Agent object from agent.py.

To train the models run trainModels.py, the hyperparameters are in hyperparameters.py and the model design is in model.py.
